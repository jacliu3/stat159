<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Reproducibility - the idea that others can independently conduct a similar analysis and come to the same conclusions - has become a major factor in assessing projects and research. In this paper we discuss the role of basic tools for achieving reproducibility, namely markdown, pandoc, make, and git. For more information on how to install or use these utilities, please Google it.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In all projects involving data analysis, there are many files and folders involved (i.e. data, code, images). Some rely on others, such as images generated from code using information from the data. It can be a complex network of relationships, making it difficult for others to understand how the final report was generated. There are countless examples of how these obstacles can lead to inaccurate and fraudulent claims, some of the more famous examples being Reinhart and Rogoff's economic work and Potti's biomedical research. Hence we rely on reproducibile research practices to elucidate the methods used and decisions made. This involved proper documentation practices, scripting/automation (using the command line over graphical user interface actions which are hard to record), and version control. These are not the only approaches to reproducible research, but they're the ones we will discuss.</p>

<p>One aspect of reproducile research is documentation, explaining design choices at every step. It can be difficult and downright tedious for an author to write-up his thought process in a text file while constantly referencing code in another, and it can be even more difficult for the reader to follow, as it becomes a constant hunt for scripts and line numbers. One solution is the integration of the two, which can be down via markup languages like Markdown. Markdown can be used to create <em>formatted</em> text (such as this very document) with plaintext syntax, allowing anyone to open, read, and edit it. In addition, because all formatting is done via the Markdown language, it holds an advantage over products like Microsoft Word and Google Docs where the GUI, though convenient, makes actions hard to reproduce.</p>

Once we have our plaintext markdown file, we would like to see the formatting rendered. In some cases, some file formats might be preferred over others; if our page is going on a website, html might be desirable. If we want to send it to others to view as is, pdf files could be more appropriate. Here lies the use of pandoc, a universal document converter that supports over 20 different formats. Hence after this paper is written in markdown, a single command
<center>
<pre><code>pandoc -s -o paper.html paper.md</code></pre>
</center>
<p>can take the markdown paper as an input and generate the html file as the output.</p>
<hr />
However, putting together a project and compiling it can be much more involved than that single single line. For instance, this paper is broken down into separate markdown files, so it must be concatenated as one before being converted. Typing multiple instructions in the command line isn't ideal, as it is slow and prone to errors while leaving no documentation of what commands were run. This defeats the goal of reproducibility, which is why we use something called a Makefile. A Makefile is essentially a file of commands which can be grouped together and named. Each grouping is called a <em>target</em> and now a multitude of commands can be executed by the single line
<center>
<pre><code>make &lt;target_name&gt;</code></pre>
</center>
<p>Now the generation of the report is documented and automated, allowing the authors and readers alike to know which commands and parameters were used and in what order.</p>

<p>Given all these tools for generating a report, what happens if we want to return to a previous version? The only thing to do really is hit ctrl-z multiple times, but if the file has already been saved and closed, then even that is no longer an option. The solution here is git, a version control system that allows us to save snapshots (aka a <em>commit</em>) of a project at a given point in time. A text description (aka a <em>commit message</em>) is appended to each snapshot to help document what was achieved in that step. For instead, for this paper, I might create a commit when I write the abstract with the message &quot;Wrote the abstract&quot; and commit again later with the message &quot;Wrote the introduction&quot;. Changes made to the project can be viewed as a series of commits, and each commit can be undone if needed (meaning all the changes made in that commit would be deleted). Git, in controlling &quot;versions&quot; of the project, not only preserves a history of a project but also allows for multiple copies of a project to exist at a certain point in time. Here, if I am writing this paper and have a sudden stroke of inspiration to make it into an app complete with games, I might be hesitant to change the paper in case I can't finish the app before the deadline. Git allows me to create a copy of my paper (called a <em>branch</em>) and make changes there while preserving the original paper. This way, if the app idea crashes and burns, I can return to my original copy and submit that for a grade. If the app works, I can <em>merge</em> the new branch with the original grade, so all the changes I made are reflected in the original paper. Because the changes are only consolidated when I call <em>merge</em>, I can be sure that the original paper will only changes once I want it to (which in this case would be when the app is fully functional). This idea of branching extends to multiple people; team members can all be working with their own branches (copies) of the project and merge their changes onto the default copy once they're sure their code/changes work. They can also checkout other people's branches to see what they're up to with a simple command of <em>checkout</em>. Git's varied functionality is very important for reproducible research, as it helps document the stages of a project.</p>

<p>The question arises: yes we're using git, but how can other people see the code that is on my laptop? This is why, in conjunction with git, we also use GitHub, an online system that hosts projects. Each project has a specific URL so when I make commits for this paper, I can <em>push</em> those changes to the Internet at that URL and other people can <em>pull</em> my changes from that URL onto their computers. There are other companies that offer similar servies (like BitBucket), but GitHub is the most popular. This paper exists on GitHub too (see github.com/jacliu3/stat159/project1) so others can read and, more importantly, grade it.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This paper hopefully demonstrated the use of certain tools for good reproducible research. It did not take too long to put together because once familiar with the resources and commands (i.e. how to use git to commit, push, pull or the markdown syntax), the workflow is streamlined and highly efficient. However, it can be difficult at first to become comfortable with their usage. The &quot;easiest&quot; part for me was the actual use of the tools while the &quot;hardest&quot; would probably be putting together this paper and deciding how to verbalize something so technically rooted. Any obstacles were overcome by the use of Google and StackOverflow; one benefit of using open-source tools is the large community that supports them. Reproducible research contributes to this collaborative society and allows for people to share their work and partake in others.</p>
