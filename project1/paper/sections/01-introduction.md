### Introduction

In all projects involving data analysis, there are many files and folders involved 
(i.e. data, code, images). Some rely on others, such as images generated from code
using information from the data. It can be a complex network of relationships, making
it difficult for others to understand how the final report was generated. There are 
countless examples of how these obstacles can lead to inaccurate and fraudulent claims,
some of the more famous examples being Reinhart and Rogoff's economic work and Potti's 
biomedical research. Hence we rely on reproducibile research practices to elucidate the
methods used and decisions made. This involved proper documentation practices, 
scripting/automation (using the command line over graphical user interface actions
which are hard to record), and version control. These are not the only approaches to 
reproducible research, but they're the ones we will discuss.
