### Conclusion

This paper hopefully demonstrated the use of certain tools for 
good reproducible research. It did not take too long to put 
together because once familiar with the resources and 
commands (i.e. how to use git to commit, push, pull or the
markdown syntax), the workflow is streamlined and highly 
efficient. However, it can be difficult at first to become 
comfortable with their usage. The "easiest" part for me was 
the actual use of the tools while the "hardest" would probably 
be putting together this paper and deciding how to verbalize 
something so technically rooted. Any obstacles were overcome 
by the use of Google and StackOverflow; one benefit of using 
open-source tools is the large community that supports them. 
Reproducible research contributes to this collaborative society 
and allows for people to share their work and partake in others.
