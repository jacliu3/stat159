### Abstract

Reproducibility - the idea that others can independently conduct a similar analysis
and come to the same conclusions - has become a major factor in assessing projects 
and research. In this paper we discuss the role of basic tools for achieving 
reproducibility, namely markdown, pandoc, make, and git. For more information on 
how to install or use these utilities, please Google it.
