### Discussion

One aspect of reproducile research is documentation, explaining design choices at
every step. It can be difficult and downright tedious for an author to write-up
his thought process in a text file while constantly referencing code in another, 
and it can be even more difficult for the reader to follow, as it becomes a 
constant hunt for scripts and line numbers. One solution is the integration of the
two, which can be down via markup languages like Markdown. Markdown can be used to 
create *formatted* text (such as this very document) with plaintext syntax, allowing
anyone to open, read, and edit it. In addition, because all formatting is done
via the Markdown language, it holds an advantage over products like Microsoft Word
and Google Docs where the GUI, though convenient, makes actions hard to reproduce.
