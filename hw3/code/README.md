### Code

There are three folders here. The *scripts* folder contains `eda-script.R`,
which calculates summary statistics of the features
of the dataset (found in `data/Advertising.csv`) and saves the 
output as `txt` file in the `data` folder. It also creates histograms
for the features, saves a `png` files in the `images` folder.
The `regression-script.R` file fits the linear models (both simple and multiple 
regression) and saves the models and their summaries in a `Rdata` file. Scatterplots
with the regression line and diagnostic plots are saved as both `png` files under the 
`images` folder.\\
