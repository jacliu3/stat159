### Data

Here in this folder we have three files. `Advertising.csv` is the original dataset by the authors of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*, Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, which can be found here: 

http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv

It has 200 observations of 4 features (*Sales, TV, Radio, Newspaper*). The other two files are outputs of our analysis, with `eda-output.txt` containing summary statistics of the dataset and `regression.Rdata` containing three linear regression models (*Sales* onto the others) and their summaries.
