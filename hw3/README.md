This is a report that demonstrates the use of simple and multiple linear regression on a toy dataset, studying the relationship between sales of a product and money spent on advertising. To generate the report, the R packages `png`, `ggplot2`, `grid`, and `xtable` are required and can be installed with the `install.packages` function. For more information, check out the session-info file, created by:
```
make session
```

Running the default *make* command by itself will recompile the paper, as well running
```
make clean
make all
```

To recreate the skeleton (NOTE: this will delete the contents of the paper), run the following commands from the project1 folder:
```
make deep-clean
make skeleton
```

This will leave you with the folders, images, and blank md files needed to recreate this paper. The data can be retrieved with the command:
```
make data
```
