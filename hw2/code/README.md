The `eda-script.R` calculates summary statistics of the features
of the dataset (found in `data/Advertising.csv`) and saves the 
output as `txt` file in the `data` folder. It also creates histograms
for the features, saving each as both `pdf` and `png` files under `images`.
The `regression-script.R` file fits the linear models, saving the models
and the summaries of the model in a `Rdata` file, and plots the data
as a scatterplot with the regression line. Again, everything is saved as
both `pdf` and `png` files under the `images` folder.
